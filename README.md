# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that provides current weather information for a given location. It allows users to search for a specific location and view the current temperature, weather conditions, forecast for the next 7 days, and other relevant data.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,and React. It utilizes the API from www.weatherapi.com to retrieve weather data based on the user's search query. The retrieved data is then displayed on the user interface in a clear and user-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Search**: Users can search for a specific location by entering the city name. The application will retrieve and display the current weather information for that location.

- **Weather Icons**: The weather conditions are represented using descriptive icons that visually indicate the current weather status.

-  **Background Changes**: The Weather App includes dynamic background changes based on the current weather conditions. These gradient changes provide a visually appealing background that reflects the weather atmosphere.

## Deployment
